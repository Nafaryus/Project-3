# Project-3
Movie Recommender
We had to achieve a movie recommender, based on any efficient approach.
We did so by using some open source databases : IMdB, OmdB, tmdb, MovieLens, GenomeTag
Creating a Streamlit app to provide a basic UI
And backing our recommender with Sickit Learn library algorithms
